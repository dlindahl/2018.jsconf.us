      Whether you just need a break from the dinner or are looking for deep
      conversation, stop by the evening campfire located on the beach. Pull up
      some sand, roast a couple marshmallows, and enjoy the stars. Make plans
      with your fellow attendees for the next or plan your space mission to the
      moon and back!
