      Whether you just need a break from the dinner or are looking for deep
      conversation, stop by the evening campfires located on the upper-level of
      the Edge Pool. Grab a spot around the natural gas firepits and enjoy some
      enlightened conversation. Make plans with your fellow attendees for the
      next day or plan your space mission to the moon and back!
