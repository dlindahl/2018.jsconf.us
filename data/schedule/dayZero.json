The bus will have the community JS logo clearly displayed on the bus, so be sure to look for that! If you find a bus with the @horse_js logo, we have no idea where that bus will go and leave it up to the reader to decide their own course of action. If you are close enough to drive, the hotel has parking available at a faily rate. Check-in, get settled, and get ready for an amazing conference!",
