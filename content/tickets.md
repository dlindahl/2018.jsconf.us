JSConf US tickets have always been one of the hottest tickets around. Our constant dedication to quality, attention to details, and willingness to experiment have established us as leaders of the technology conference format. This year will be no exception!

Your ticket provides you access to all of the social events, all of the lectures, and one of the ["Choose Your Own Adventure" sessions](/schedule/#day-two). The ticket price also covers at least nine (9) hot and amazing meals prepared for you by our incredible on-site chef over the five (5) days of JSConf US. If you need any assistance/encouragement to help solidify arrangements with your employer OR you require extra assistance, please don't hesitate to [contact us directly](mailto:derek@jsconf.us).

All classes of tickets are sold on a first-come, first-serve basis with no refunds offered (ticket transfers are allowed.)

# Ticket Add-ons

## Special Preparation Meal Ticket

### $20

We have provided specially prepared meals for those with specific dietary requirements since 2010. Every year 90% of those meal are left uneaten. These meals often cost more than the buffet meals provided to other attendees due to the special requirements needed to prepare them.

If you require a specially prepared meal, vegan or otherwise, that cannot be serviced as part of a group buffet, we ask that you purchase a Special Preparation Meal Ticket. With this meal ticket, we will have a specially prepared plate reserved for you at every meal and social event that meets your dietary needs. If you have any questions about this, please [email us directly](mailto:derek@jsconf.us).
