Whether you love them or hate them, the use of a spinning loader (i.e. loading spinner) is common practice when performing asynchronous calls. They give the illusion to the end user that work is being performed; however, in reality they're just transparent liars. This talk will cover how we elegantly load and visualize a stream of a million or more data points using reactive programming. We'll explain why and how we did it, we'll dive deep into some code, but most importantly, we'll do it without lying to your face.
