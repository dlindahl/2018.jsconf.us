Itâ€™s been 3 years since the ES6 spec was finalized, and modern browsers are up to speed, but it's surprising how few teams have delved beyond syntactic sugar. How much of the first - and last - major update to the language in 20 years has turned out to be useful in practice, and how much is just hype? Tim Doherty will walk through his journey learning and championing enterprise adoption of ES6 at his previous job, and his observations along the way. Join Tim for an informative and entertaining case study of ES6 in practice.
