"I just wanted to wiggle a button with jQuery, I don't know anything about magical quartz!" a disciple said to the master in despair. No matter how they try to draw pixels, the master seems to riddle them with esoteric knowledge of gleaming stones...

If you are confused, overwhelmed, or feel drawing in the current state of web development despite having honed your JavaScript skills, this talk is for you. We are surrounded by many frameworks and tutorials on _how_ to build web applications, but we rarely get to hear about the mechanics of the environment where our code runs. In this talk, we are going to look at how a browser receives your code, read your code, and execute your code so you can create fast loading and smooth rendering web experience.

Even though we are going to look what happens inside of a web browser, prior knowledge of hardware and low-level programming are not necessary. Everything will be guided with illustrations and stories. After all, building a web app is about how to communicate to draw pictures on screen :)
