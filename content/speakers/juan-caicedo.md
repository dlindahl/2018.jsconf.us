The experienced Javascript developer has learned they should never use switch statements. They have tricky semantics and force a very imperative style, good riddance! Yet, this type of construct has a very important place in other languages, both Object Oriented and Functional, and it is beloved by programmers of those languages. This talk introduces the early stage TC-39 proposal for pattern matching, the new incarnation of switch statements for JS. It will cover the proposed semantics of this language feature, as well as its potential applications to front-end applications (through React/JSX) and back-end applications (through Node/Express). By the end, developers will be able to test out this experimental feature at home, and will be able to provide feedback to directly improve the proposal.
