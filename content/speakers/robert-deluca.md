_Fact_: Full acceptance test suites that run in the browser are slow, flakey, awkward to write, and hard to maintain. This is the lore that has been handed down to JavaScript developers for generations. But what if that fact was fiction? What if your UI tests were fast, robust _and_ a breeze to maintain? Introducing BigTest. The framework that believes you don't need to make compromises in order to make tests that faithfully replicate your production environment. Weâ€™ll explore how BigTest upends the boring and often painful subject of UI testing and makes it fast, robust, and a pleasure to work with.
