Everything that happens in a frontend application is asynchronous; events happen – a user types something, a server responds with data – and our programs react. The traditional approach to this problem is to deal with asynchronous “parts” of your application in callbacks or promises, while working with static data structures and behaving as if the rest of the program were synchronous. After years of writing frontend apps, I still find this confusing and cumbersome. What if there were a better way? This is premise of RxJS, a functional reactive programming library. We treat data itself as asynchronous – as streams which represent a snapshot a given value over time. Functional reactive programming is a conceptual shift -- but it can vastly simplify frontend programming. I'll show you some tools I've written to make the FRP learning curve simpler. You can use it regardless of what javascript MVC you rely on. I can even show you how I use React with RxJS instead of Redux! If you're willing to try something new, I guarantee your mind will be blown!
