As a visually impaired front end developer, our profession can bring its own set of challenges; however, there are many tools and techniques that engineers can use to overcome various obstacles. I hope that by sharing some of my experiences, my talk will inspire other visually challenged people to pursue a career in front end development as well as help those currently working in the software development field.
