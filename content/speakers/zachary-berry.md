This talk is all about the weird world of hardware music visualizers (from 1977 with the Atari Video Music up to the newer modular video synthesizers of today) and recreating them in the browser! Thanks to Javascript and several newer web APIs it's possible to build a video synth to play live in a music performance. With the evil powers of "eval" it can also be coded live and with the WebAudio, WebMIDI and Gamepad APIs we can do beat detection and MIDI clock detection. Then we can get physical and manipulate our visualizer with a MIDI controller or an Xbox gamepad.
