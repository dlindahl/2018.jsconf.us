Development is definitely an interactive exercise. Improving our craft with each subsequent release is our Picasso to the world (or company intranet). With systems becoming ever more complex, the fog of development can set in; no one person can have a clear view of the entire end-to-end system. One area that NodeJS ecosystem would improve on is dependency management. The `package.json` grows longer and wider, a sanity check to see if there are duplicates. When compared to Java, a class collision is not going to occur; usually up to the JS-C which to load in the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) first. Which packages duplicating dependencies e.g “for packages has JQuery”, how can you tell what is what.
