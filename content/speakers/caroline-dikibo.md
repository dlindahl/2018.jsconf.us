Budgets, Housing, and Hurricanes. What do all of these things have in common? Civic Hacking. These were local problems that were tackled by a village of coding warriors.

In this talk, I will talk about how I used JavaScript in specific projects that came out of Austin, giving citizens exposure to city budgeting with Award-winning Budget Party, and Houston, tackling Section 8, and then I will finish out the talk with current event-driven civic hacking that led to the Hurricane app creating effort covered by Forbes.
