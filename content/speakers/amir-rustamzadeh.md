We all want to consistently ship quality software. One of the best ways to do that is by end-to-end (E2E) testing our code as it simulates the real actions of our beloved users. Let’s be frank though, E2E testing is notoriously time-consuming, expensive, slow, and often flaky. Unfortunately, these issues lead to developers doing very little to no E2E testing, and taking solace in a plethora of unit-tests. We can do better. We should do better. We will do better. In this session, we’ll dive deep into using a modern testing tool, Cypress, that enables us to easily and beautifully write flake-free, reliable, deterministic E2E tests for our shiny web applications. Like a good friend, E2E tests should be there to give us confidence in the software we release down the wire.
