🎶 Imagination, imagination. A dream, can be, a dream come true. With just that spark, in me and you! 🎶

Nothing will beat the feeling I had as a child at EPCOT’s Imagination Pavilion. Before the internet, this was my first taste of technology, and it was hands on. Figment (the official mascot) made me feel like I COULD do ANYTHING, and everyone should feel this way about everything they create.

“There’s really no secret about our approach. We keep moving forward-- opening new doors and doing new things-- because we’re curious. And curiosity keeps leading us down new paths. We’re always exploring and experimenting.. we call it Imagineering- the blending of creative imagination and technical knowledge.” - Walt Disney

Let’s take a journey through our own imaginations to see what we can make with our ideas and skills while considering the Disney Imagineer process instills on its engineering practices to get the most impact. There’s no reason why anything we create needs to be dry, sometimes you just need a spark of ✨ magic ✨.
