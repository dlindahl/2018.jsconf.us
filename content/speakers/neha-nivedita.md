React is amazing for creating web apps -- but do we know if the React apps we create are usable by everyone? ‘a11y’ stands for ‘accessibility’ - the design and creation of websites that can be used by everyone -- including persons with disabilities. Contrary to popular conceptions, accessibility is not so much a "feature" in software development, as it is a necessity.

React provides good support for accessible design. In this talk we will learn how to build React components to that support assistive technology (like screen readers) and also learn how to write unit tests to check our components for accessibility of features -- thus ensuring that our apps are usable by everyone equally.
