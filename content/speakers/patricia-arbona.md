I will be speaking about my journey of breaking into tech as a queer Latinx woman, with a non-traditional background. My path into tech was very challenging: there were many times I was very frustrated and disillusioned with the tech industry.

Mentorship has had an exponentially positive effect on my career, technical abilities, and feeling of self worth.
