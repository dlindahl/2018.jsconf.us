Machine Learning is a remarkable thing - processing enormous sets of data to make predictions just like a human brain does, only capable of much more difficult and important tasks. Tasks like finally taking the giant horse mask off of the @horse_js twitter account to see whoâ€™s underneath. In this session, Jasmine and Burke will walk you through how they used data science and Machine Learning to finally put Machine Learning to good use and determine the true human identity of @horse_js. The truth is out there!
