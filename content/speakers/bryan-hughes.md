Like all mental illnesses, dealing with anxiety is hard because it permeates everything in my life. One specific way anxiety complicates things is by making it difficult to keep in touch with people. So I created a JavaScript app to help me. In this talk, I'll discuss how my brain works and why it gets in the way of communicating with people I care about. Then, I'll walk you through how I created this app and remixed common design patterns to cater to my anxiety specifically.
